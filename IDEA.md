🧠 The **AI Form Generator** is a smart app idea where users type a prompt like “Create a job application form,” and the app uses GPT to instantly generate a complete form with relevant fields—name, email, resume upload, etc.

### 🔧 Key Features You Can Build
- **Prompt-to-Form Conversion**: Use GPT to interpret user input and generate form fields dynamically.
- **Live Preview**: Show the form as it's being built.
- **Form Publishing**: Let users share or embed the generated form.
- **Response Dashboard**: Admins can view submissions in a clean UI.
- **Authentication**: Add login/signup with NextAuth.
- **Styling**: Use TailwindCSS or Shadcn UI for sleek design.

### 🧪 Tech Stack Suggestions
- **Next.js + React**: For frontend and routing
- **OpenAI or Gemini API**: For prompt processing
- **PostgreSQL or Supabase**: To store form data
- **Drizzle ORM**: For database management
- **CopilotKit**: To add in-app AI chat or sidebar
